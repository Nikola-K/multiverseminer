### Backstory


You begin the game in an area, known as the "CSF headquarters" (Cosmic Special Forces).

You receive an order, to assemble a team and prepare for an emergency mission. The team of 3 is automatically chosen for you and a ship is provided.

After acquiring the piece, it's installed, and your flight begins to the moon to plant a building which will automatically gather Helium-3.

As you are returning to earth, massive explosions can be seen. A huge black hole is opened, in close proximity to earth and thousands of alien ships fly through, and begin firing their weapons at earth.

The captain orders the ship to change course. Alien ships can be seen penetrating Earths atmosphere, firing lasers in all directions. Some ships fly back through the hole, and others remain on earth. You decide to wait for confirmation that its safe to return.

Your food is running out, and your water supply is low. Your orders to re-enter never come, so the captain makes the decision to return to earth.

Earth is a wasteland. Upon landing you are captured by aliens, your ship destroyed.

Over production and mining of earths resources by the aliens and crowding of the remaining humans in to camps have turned it into a foul, garbage-strewn dystopia. You only hope of survival is escape. With the knowledge you have at your disposal, you could scrounge together enough resources to build a ship and find help.

But first, you have to escape the camp you have been placed in. Choose a profession (the other 3 in your group are auto generated base on your choice), Mine/Gather/Scavenge enough resources to break out of your camp, and begin your journey to the stars... and beyond.

Armed with only a trusty pickaxe, your journey begins.
